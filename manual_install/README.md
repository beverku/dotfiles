# Manual installation of some things
Anything in this folder is not installed by the .dotfiles/install.sh script
Probably because it is not idempotent - or only wants to be run once

# For each *thing* that should be installed manually 
1) create a sub-directory
2) create an install script or instructions

~~~
cd 
~/.dotfiles/manual_install/<thing>/install.sh
